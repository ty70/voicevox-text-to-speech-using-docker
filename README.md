# VOICEVOX Text-to-Speech Web App with Streamlit using Docker

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that synthesizes Japanese speech from text using the VOICEVOX engine, which is run inside Docker.

---

## ‚ú® Features

* Easy-to-use voice synthesis through a Streamlit web UI in your browser

* The VOICEVOX engine runs in Docker (requires Docker with NVIDIA GPU support)

* Includes speaker selection, audio playback, and download functionality

---

## ‚ö° How to Run

### 1. Build the VOICEVOX engine in Docker

#### Pull and run the Docker image

```bash
docker pull voicevox/voicevox_engine:nvidia-latest
docker run --rm --gpus all -p '127.0.0.1:50021:50021' voicevox/voicevox_engine:nvidia-latest
```

This will start the VOICEVOX engine.

### 2. Install required Python packages

In a separate terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or:

```bash
pip install streamlit requests
```

### 3. Launch the Streamlit app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Once running, the app will be accessible in your web browser.

### 4. Stop the VOICEVOX ENGINE

```bash
docker stop `docker ps | grep voicevox | awk '{print $1}'`
```

To remove the container image if needed:

```bash
docker rmi `docker images | grep voicevox | awk '{print $3}'`
```
